 //will use layered panes, and a combo box connected to a switch statement, so depending on what item is selected in the combo box when the view button is hit will be the table to appear
 //a bit torn between what reports i will write as right now the student class isnt completed by karawan, my original idea was to display a report from their school attendance and grades, however for now i might save their score as a variable foe the quizzes and display a report on that 
 //i would like to create a report option that is only visible to admmin accounts, so maybe a report of any deletions, additions and edits to admin accounts and by whom //maybe save name , time and what they did to a txt file and print it back out into a table
